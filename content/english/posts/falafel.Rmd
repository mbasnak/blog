This recipe yields about 15 falafel. The most important part is that you use dry chickpeas!


#Ingredients

- 1/2 pound dry chickpeas

- 1/2 onion

- 2 garlic cloves

- 1 tbsp flour

- 1 tsp comino

- 1 tsp salt

- pepper to taste

- 1/3 cup chopped parsley

- 1/3 cup chopped cilantro


#Directions

- Soak the chickpeas overnight with plenty of water.

- The next day, drain and rinse them.

- Put them in a blender or food processor with the onion, garlic, cumin, flour, cumin, salt, pepper, chopped cilantro and parsley.

- Process everything well, but it shouldn't get liquid and should still have texture.

- Put the mix in the fridge for about 2 h or in the freezer for about 30 min.

- Shape them and cook them in the oven at medium-high heat with some oil for about 25 min, flipping them half way through.

- If you're baking them, making them rather flat as in the picture. If you want to fry them, you can shape them into balls.

- I served them with a dip of cream cheese, mil, curry and garlic powder, and another one with mayo, mustard, lemon and olive oil.
