#Ingredients

##For the pastry

- 2 cups all purpose flour

- 1 tsp salt

- 2 tsp thyme

- 1/2 cup water

- 1/2 cup vegetable oil

##For the filling

- 1 onion

- 1 red bell pepper

- 1/2 small broccoli head

- 1 zucchini

- 2 big cremini mushrooms

- 2 handfulls grated mozzarella

- salt to taste

- pepper to taste

- olive oil to taste

##For the binding mix

- 3 eggs

- 2 tbsp heavy cream

- salt to taste

- pepper to taste


#Directions

- For the pastry, combine all the ingredients.

- Knead until you get a homogeneous dough and leave it aside.

- For the filling, cut the onion and red pepper and saute in olive oil a few min.

- Add the chopped broccoli and cook a few more min.

- Add the chopped zucchini and sliced mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and cook until the broccoli is done.

- Roll the dough. You can make 1 individual big quiche or 4 small ones. I didn't have a tin for making small tartlets, so I shaped the pastry in a way that would contain the filling.

- Fill the tartlets with the veggies, add the grated mozzarella and a few tbsp of the binding mix.

- Cook at medium heat for about 30 min.
