- Macro bowls are bowls with ingredients that try to cover every dietary need: they have proteins, fats, carbohidrates, minerals and vitamins.

- You can make infinite combinations. They are usually very colorful and tasty.

- For the hidrates, some ideas are rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, quinoa...

- For protein, you can use chicken, legumes, tofu...

- For fats, you can add cheese, avocado, seeds, or add the fat to the seasoning (olive oil, mayo,...).

- And add many veggies!!

- The seasoning is really important. You can experiment with different vinaigrettes until you find one that you like. One that I use a lot for my salads and bowls has a minced garlic clove, a tbsp of mustard, a tbsp mayonaise, two tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper, and a small splash of water.
