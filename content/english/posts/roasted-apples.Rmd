These roasted apples are ideal for when you're craving something sweet but don't have too many ingredients, or don't feel like cooking a very elaborated dish! I served them with toasted walnuts, but they are also delicious with ice cream or whipped cream (or all of the above).

#Ingredients

- granny smith apples (1 per persona)

- 1 tbsp honey

- cinnamon to taste

- a splash of lemon juice

- walnuts to taste


#Directions

- Cut the apples in halves and remove their heart.

- Put on a oven dish and add lemon, cinamon and honey.

- Cook in the oven at high heat for about 20 min.

- Add the walut pieces, and cook for 10 more min.

- Serve with more cinnamon and honey.
