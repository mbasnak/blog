<p>I had a hard time finding a comercial granola that I liked. I usually find them too sweet, not sweet enough, or I think that they don’t have enough nuts. So I decided to make my own, and I always have it at home for breakfast. It’s really tasty on its own, or with yogurt, milk and fruits.</p>
<div id="ingredients" class="section level1">
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>4 cups of oats</p></li>
<li><p>1 and 1/2 cups of nuts (I used almonds and walnuts)</p></li>
<li><p>1 handful of dried fruit (I used dried cranberries)</p></li>
<li><p>1/3 cup of honey</p></li>
<li><p>1 splash of neutral vegetable oil</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="directions" class="section level1">
<h1>Directions</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Pre-heat the oven at 350 F.</p></li>
<li><p>Chop the nuts</p></li>
<li><p>Combine every ingredient except for the dried fruit. If the honey is solid, melt in the microwave for a few seconds before adding.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the mix in the biggest oven dish you have.</p></li>
<li><p>Cook in the oven for about 10-12 min.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove from the over, mix, and cook again for 10-12 min.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove it from the oven and let it dry.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the dry fruit.</p></li>
</ul>
