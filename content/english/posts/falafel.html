<p>This recipe yields about 15 falafel. The most important part is that you use dry chickpeas!</p>
<div id="ingredients" class="section level1">
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>1/2 pound dry chickpeas</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 onion</p></li>
<li><p>2 garlic cloves</p></li>
<li><p>1 tbsp flour</p></li>
<li><p>1 tsp comino</p></li>
<li><p>1 tsp salt</p></li>
<li><p>pepper to taste</p></li>
<li><p>1/3 cup chopped parsley</p></li>
<li><p>1/3 cup chopped cilantro</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Directions</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Soak the chickpeas overnight with plenty of water.</p></li>
<li><p>The next day, drain and rinse them.</p></li>
<li><p>Put them in a blender or food processor with the onion, garlic, cumin, flour, cumin, salt, pepper, chopped cilantro and parsley.</p></li>
<li><p>Process everything well, but it shouldn’t get liquid and should still have texture.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the mix in the fridge for about 2 h or in the freezer for about 30 min.</p></li>
<li><p>Shape them and cook them in the oven at medium-high heat with some oil for about 25 min, flipping them half way through.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re baking them, making them rather flat as in the picture. If you want to fry them, you can shape them into balls.</p></li>
<li><p>I served them with a dip of cream cheese, mil, curry and garlic powder, and another one with mayo, mustard, lemon and olive oil.</p></li>
</ul>
