These amounts are for few nuts, to serve as snack for a couple days. If you want to have them for longer or to feed several people, you can triple the amount. You can make this with any nut and it will be very tasty.

#Ingredients

- 1/2 cup of raw almonds

- 1/2 cup of sugar

- 1/4 cup of water

If you want, you can add a tsp of vanilla extract

#Directions

- Put all the ingredients in a small pot.

- Cook constantly stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the caramel is lightly golden.

- Remove from the fire and continue to stir until the sugar cristalizes.

- If the cristalized lugar look white, go back to the stove for a couple minutes until it gets dark gold.

- Remove from the stove and put the mix on a silicone pad or a greased piece of alumium foil, trying to separate the nuts such that they won't become a great clump when dry.
