Learn how to make super easy chocolates using a ice tray! This recipe yields 9 big chocolates.

#Ingredients

- 2 handfulls of chocolate chips or chopped chocolate

- 60 gr condensed milk

- 60 gr grated coconut



#Directions

- Melt the chocolate au bain marie.

- Cover an ice tray with the chocolate, flipping it to remove the extra chocolate.

- Mix the condensed milk with the grated coconut, and add some of the mix in every hole, on top of the chocolate layer.

- Cover with more melted chocolate.

- Put it in the fridge.

- I used a silicone ice tray so they came out easily once the chocolate solidified. If you don't have a silicone tray, add a little bit of vegetable oil to the tray.

- Try different fillings! They are delicious with caramel, nuts, white chocolate and may more things.
