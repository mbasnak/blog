<p>Florentines are really tasty very thin italian cookies made with nuts and chocolate. I had nuts and chocolate and wanted to bake something but I didn’t want to go with the original recipe because it implies spooning the mix super thin and baking several trays to get all the cookies. So I made a similar version but with thicker cookies, baked in a muffin tray instead, to make it simpler :) They are great to eat in the afternoon with some coffee or tea (but really bad if you’re on a diet!)</p>

<li><p>2 tbsp all purpose flour</p></li>

<h1>Directions</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Turn on the oven at 350 F.</p></li>
<li><p>Chop the almonds finely or process them (but don’t turn them into dust).</p></li>
<li><p>Mix the almonds, flour and lemon zest.</p></li>
<li><p>In a small pot, heat the honey, sugar, butter and milk, stirring until the sugar melts. Continue to heat until it boils and turn off the stove.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix the two preparations and let cool for about 20 min, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
<li><p>Grease a muffin tray.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a tbsp of prep to each tin: this amount yielded 12 cookies for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Cook for about 15 min.</p></li>
<li><p>Cool.</p></li>
<li><p>Microwave some chocolate (not very long or it will burn!) or heat with a bain marie on the stove.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a little bit of chocolate on each cookie.</p></li>
</ul>
