#Ingredients

- 1 egg

- 4 tbsp flour

- salt to taste

- pepper to taste

- oil to taste


#Directions

- Grate the potatoes.

- Add the egg, the flour, the seasoning and combine everything.

- Shape disks with your hand and put them in an oven dish with aluminum foil and some oil.

- Cook at high heat for about 10 min, flip them, and cook them 10 more min on the other side.

- I served them with a dip made with 2 tbsp mayo, 1 tsp mustard, 1/2 minced garlic clove and some rosemary.
