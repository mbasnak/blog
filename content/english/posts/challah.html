<p>This is my bubbe Perla’s challah recipe. I’ve tatsed many challahs in my life, including the one they taught us to make in the bread class in cooking school and no bread came close to being as tasty as this one! It is a little sweeter than most. I think than that extra sugar and the loads of yeast it has make it delicious. Enjoy!</p>
