- 2.5 oz sugar

- 1 tsp vanilla extract

- 3 ripe bananas

- 1 or 2 handfulls of chocolate chips or chopped chocolate

#Directions

- Whisk the cream until it gets firm, but not so firm that you can turn the bowl over your head.

- Add the ripe mashed bananas, the vanilla extract, and the chocolate.

- In a small pot, make a siroup heating the sugar with some water (enough water to barely cover the sugar) until the sugar disolves and the liquid starts making medium size bubbles.

- While the siroup is heating, whisk the eggs (ideally with a machine) until they make a thick and foamy mix.

- Pour the hot siroup gradually over the eggs and keep whisking the mix util the bowl is cold.

- Add this mix to the banana cream mix.

- Freeze for at least 7 h.
