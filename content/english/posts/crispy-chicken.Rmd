#Ingredients

- 2 chicken breasts

- 3 tbsp mustard

- 1 and 1/2 tsp garlic powder or minced garlic

- 2 tbsp olive oil

- 1/2 cup oats

- 1 and 1/2 tsp paprika

- salt to taste

- pepper to taste



#Directions

- Make a paste mixing the mustard, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper.

- Cover the chicken breasts (cut in smaller pieces if they're too big) with the paste.

- Grind the oats and the paprika.

- Roll the chicken breasts on the oat mix.

- Cook at medium heat in the oven until they're very golden (you can fry them if you prefer).
