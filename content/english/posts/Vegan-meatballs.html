<p>About a year ago, I started eating much less meat. I had to adapt my diet to near vegetarianism and the main thing I changed was that I started eating way more legumes. I didn’t have any issues doing that, because I love them, but Mati, my partner, struggles to eat some of them. That was until I managed to make these black been ‘meatballs’, and he loved them! They don’t taste like meat, so if thats what you’re after, you’re in the wrong post, but they are very tasty! I usually make them with an egg, but I had run out, so I had to get creative about it, and they became vegan ‘meatballs’.</p>

<li><p>Add an egg or a ‘seed egg’ (to make the seed egg: ground 1 tbsp of flax seeds with 3 tbsp of water until you obtain a homogeneous mix; set for 5 min until it thickens). This egg can be done with other types of seeds too. The most common one is with chia seeds.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the breadcrums and combine everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Shape the ‘meatballs’.</p></li>
<li><p>Add some olive oil to a hot pan.</p></li>
