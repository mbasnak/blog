Florentines are really tasty very thin italian cookies made with nuts and chocolate. I had nuts and chocolate and wanted to bake something but I didn't want to go with the original recipe because it implies spooning the mix super thin and baking several trays to get all the cookies. So I made a similar version but with thicker cookies, baked in a muffin tray instead, to make it simpler :) They are great to eat in the afternoon with some coffee or tea (but really bad if you're on a diet!)


#Ingredients

- 1 cup of peeled nuts (I used almonds, [check out how to peel them here](/en/blog/how-to-peel-almonds))

- zest of 1 lemon

- 2 tbsp all purpose flour

- 1/4 cup sugar

- 1/2 stick unsalted butter

- 1 tbsp honey

- a couple tbsp milk

- a coupe tbsp chocolate chips or chocolate chopped in small pieces


# Directions

- Turn on the oven at 350 F.

- Chop the almonds finely or process them (but don't turn them into dust).

- Mix the almonds, flour and lemon zest.

- In a small pot, heat the honey, sugar, butter and milk, stirring until the sugar melts. Continue to heat until it boils and turn off the stove.

- Mix the two preparations and let cool for about 20 min, stirring occasionally.

- Grease a muffin tray.

- Add a tbsp of prep to each tin: this amount yielded 12 cookies for me.

- Cook for about 15 min.

- Cool.

- Microwave some chocolate (not very long or it will burn!) or heat with a bain marie on the stove.

- Add a little bit of chocolate on each cookie.
