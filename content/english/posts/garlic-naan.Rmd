Enjoy this very quick and easy garlic naan version! (or plain naan if you prefer it). This recipe yields 4 thicker naans or 6 thin naans. 

#Ingredients

- 1 & 1/2 cup all purpose flour

- 2 tsp sugar

- 1 tbsp oil

- 1/4 to 1/3 cups milk

- 1/2 tsp baking powder

- 1/2 tsp salt

- 2 garlic cloves

- 2 tbsp butter


#Directions

- Mix the flour, baking powder and salt.

- Make a well in the middle of the mix and add the oil and milk.

- Knead until you get a homogeneous roll, adding flour if necessary.

- Leave the dough rest for 10 min.

- Divide the dough and roll to get the desired width.

- Cook the bread in a very hot pan with a splash of oil, 1 min on each side or until it gets golden.

- Mince the garlic, mix with the butter and heat in the microwave until the butter melts.

- Serve the bread with the garlic-butter mix (I like it with raw garlic, but you can saute the garlic first if you prefer it that way).
