<p>I love soup, and this is my favorite! It is very simple, has very few ingredients. You will need a blender of some sort. You can make it vegan by skipping the cream (you can replace it with coconut milk).</p>
<div id="ingredients" class="section level1">
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>1.5 pounds butternut squash</p></li>
<li><p>2 carrots</p></li>
<li><p>1 vegetable bouillon cube</p></li>
<li><p>a splash of heavy cream</p></li>
<li><p>salt to taste</p></li>
<li><p>pepper to taste</p></li>
<li><p>nutmeg to taste</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="directions" class="section level1">
<h1>Directions</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Peel the squash and carrots and cut them in pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>Cook the veggies in a pot with water and the bouillon cube.</p></li>
<li><p>When the veggies are soft, turn off the stove.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the veggies in a blender and add the stock gradually, blending in steps and adding the amount of liquid that gives you a texture you’re happy with. I like it pretty thick so I don’t add too much liquid, pero you can tune this to what you like.</p></li>
<li><p>Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, and add a splash of heavy cream.</p></li>
<li><p>Serve with toasted seeds (either those of the squash or others).</p></li>
</ul>
