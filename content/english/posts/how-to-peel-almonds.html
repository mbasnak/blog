<p>You can buy already peeled almonds but they are usually much more expensive. If you have to use many if might be worth it, but if you need a reasonable amount and have a few extra min, a recommend peeling them at home.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Boil some water.</p></li>
<li><p>Once it’s boiling, add the almonds and leave for 30 to 60 sec. They are going to start rising. Don’t leave them longer because they might get soggy!</p></li>
<li><p>Turn off the heat and strain them.</p></li>
<li><p>Rinse with cold water and dry with paper towels or a clean cloth.</p></li>
<li><p>One by one, pince a little bit the skin and you will see it starts to come out.</p></li>
<li><p>When you’re done peeling them, you can dry them again.</p></li>
<li><p>Ready to be used! You can bake <a href="/en/blog/florentines">these delicious florentines</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
