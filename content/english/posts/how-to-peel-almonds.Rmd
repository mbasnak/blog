You can buy already peeled almonds but they are usually much more expensive. If you have to use many if might be worth it, but if you need a reasonable amount and have a few extra min, a recommend peeling them at home.

- Boil some water.

- Once it's boiling, add the almonds and leave for 30 to 60 sec. They are going to start rising. Don't leave them longer because they might get soggy!

- Turn off the heat and strain them.

- Rinse with cold water and dry with paper towels or a clean cloth.

- One by one, pince a little bit the skin and you will see it starts to come out.

- When you're done peeling them, you can dry them again.

- Ready to be used! You can bake [these delicious florentines](/en/blog/florentines).
