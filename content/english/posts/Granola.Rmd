I had a hard time finding a comercial granola that I liked. I usually find them too sweet, not sweet enough, or I think that they don't have enough nuts. So I decided to make my own, and I always have it at home for breakfast. It's really tasty on its own, or with yogurt, milk and fruits.

#Ingredients

- 4 cups of oats

- 1 and 1/2 cups of nuts (I used almonds and walnuts)

- 1 handful of dried fruit (I used dried cranberries)

- 1/3 cup of honey

- 1 splash of neutral vegetable oil


#Directions

- Pre-heat the oven at 350 F.

- Chop the nuts

- Combine every ingredient except for the dried fruit. If the honey is solid, melt in the microwave for a few seconds before adding.

- Distribute the mix in the biggest oven dish you have.

- Cook in the oven for about 10-12 min.

- Remove from the over, mix, and cook again for 10-12 min.

- Remove it from the oven and let it dry.

- Add the dry fruit.
