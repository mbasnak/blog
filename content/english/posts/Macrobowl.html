<ul>
<li><p>Macro bowls are bowls with ingredients that try to cover every dietary need: they have proteins, fats, carbohidrates, minerals and vitamins.</p></li>
<li><p>You can make infinite combinations. They are usually very colorful and tasty.</p></li>
<li><p>For the hidrates, some ideas are rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, quinoa…</p></li>
<li><p>For protein, you can use chicken, legumes, tofu…</p></li>
<li><p>For fats, you can add cheese, avocado, seeds, or add the fat to the seasoning (olive oil, mayo,…).</p></li>
<li><p>And add many veggies!!</p></li>
<li><p>The seasoning is really important. You can experiment with different vinaigrettes until you find one that you like. One that I use a lot for my salads and bowls has a minced garlic clove, a tbsp of mustard, a tbsp mayonaise, two tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper, and a small splash of water.</p></li>
</ul>
