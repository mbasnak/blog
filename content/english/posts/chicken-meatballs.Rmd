#Ingredients

- 1 large chicken breast

- 2 tbsp cream cheese

- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs

- 1 egg

- 2 tsp garlic powder

- 2 tsp paprika

- salt to taste

- pepper to taste

- vegetable oil to taste


#Directions

- Process 1 chicken breast with the cream cheese, egg, breadcrumbs, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper.

- Shape meatballs with the mix.

- Cook in a pan with some oil. First cook them a few min on each side at high heat until they're golden, then lower the heat, cover the pan and cook about 4 more min.

- I served them with 3 dips. One with mayo, mustard, olive oil and lemon. The second one was a tomato sauce made with tomato, onion, oregano, brown sugar, salt and pepper. The third one was honey mustard.
