This hummus is super tasty with bread, vegetable sticks (carrots, zuchini, peppers) or added as a seasoning to a salad. You can skip the pepper and make regular hummus, or replace with other roasted veggies if you prefer (it is great with carrots or beats!).

#Ingredients

- 1 can of chickpeas

- 1 roasted red pepper

- 1 and Â½ garlic cloves

- 1/2 cup olive oil

- 1 splash lemon juice

#Directions:

- Roast the pepper [see here how to easily roast peppers](/en/blog/how-to-roast-peppers/).
