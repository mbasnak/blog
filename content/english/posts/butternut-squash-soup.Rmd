I love soup, and this is my favorite! It is very simple, has very few ingredients. You will need a blender of some sort. You can make it vegan by skipping the cream (you can replace it with coconut milk).


#Ingredients

- 1.5 pounds butternut squash

- 2 carrots

- 1 vegetable bouillon cube

- a splash of heavy cream

- salt to taste

- pepper to taste

- nutmeg to taste



#Directions

- Peel the squash and carrots and cut them in pieces.

- Cook the veggies in a pot with water and the bouillon cube.

- When the veggies are soft, turn off the stove.

- Put the veggies in a blender and add the stock gradually, blending in steps and adding the amount of liquid that gives you a texture you're happy with. I like it pretty thick so I don't add too much liquid, pero you can tune this to what you like.

- Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, and add a splash of heavy cream.

- Serve with toasted seeds (either those of the squash or others).
