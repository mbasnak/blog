- This technique to roast peppers is super easy!

- You only need a pepper and a stove (it has to be a gas stove).

- Turn on the stove and place the pepper on the flame.

- Every couple minutes, rotate it.

- The skin will turn black (like in the picture).

- It looks burned but it's ok like this!

- Once every side gets black, remove from the stove and rinse with cold water, rubbing it to remove the skin.

- That's it! Roasted pepper ready to enjoy.
