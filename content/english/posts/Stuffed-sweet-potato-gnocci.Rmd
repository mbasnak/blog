#Ingredients (For 2 people who want to eat a lot or for 3)

- 1.65 pounds sweet potato

- 1 egg yolk

- 1 and 2/3 cups of all purpose flour

- a little bit of mozzarella cheese for the stuffing

- 1 tbsp butter

- salt to taste

- pepper to taste

- nutmeg to taste

#Directions

- Boil the sweet potatoes and make a mash with the tbsp of butter.

- Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.

- Add the egg yolk and flour and combine until you obtain a homogeneous dough.

- Shape the gnocci, bigger than regular gnocci, and add a little bit of cheese inside.

- Cook in boiling water and when they rise in the pot, strain.

- Serve with your favorite sauce. I chose to serve it with bechamel sauce (made with 1 tbsp butter, 1 and 1/2 tbsp all purpose flour, and 1 cup of milk), spinach and mushrooms sauted with garlic, and grated cheese.
